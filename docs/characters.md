# strange characters

- this is where I will put weird text characters that break code
- eof bom etc.
- punctuation and other content used as code

```text
\n  --> newline, not backslash n
\r  --> carriage return, not backslash r
\t  --> tab, not backslash t
\f  --> formfeed, not backslash f
```

- goofy upside down double quotes and such break stuff

```sh
’'` ''"
```

- goofy em and en dashes

```sh
– -  —
```
