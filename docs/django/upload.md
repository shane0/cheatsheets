# upload a file

To upload a file and save it to the drive using Django without using the database or models, you can follow these steps:

1. Get the file from the request.
2. Create a new file object using the `open()` function.
3. Write the contents of the uploaded file to the new file object.
4. Close the new file object.
5. Save the new file object to the desired location.

Here is a simple example of how to upload a file and save it to the drive using Django without using the database or models:

```python
import os

def upload_file(request):
    # Get the file from the request.
    file = request.FILES['file']

    # Create a new file object.
    with open(os.path.join('/path/to/save/file', file.name), 'wb') as new_file:
        # Write the contents of the uploaded file to the new file object.
        for chunk in file.chunks():
            new_file.write(chunk)

```

This will save the uploaded file to the location `/path/to/save/file` with the file name `file.name`.

You can also use Django's `FileSystemStorage` class to save the file to the drive without using the database or models. The `FileSystemStorage` class provides a convenient way to manage files stored on the filesystem. To use the `FileSystemStorage` class, you first need to create a `FileSystemStorage` object. You can then use the `save()` method on the `FileSystemStorage` object to save the uploaded file to the drive.

Here is a simple example of how to use the `FileSystemStorage` class to save a file to the drive without using the database or models:

```python
from django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage

def upload_file(request):
    # Get the file from the request.
    file = request.FILES['file']

    # Create a FileSystemStorage object.
    fs = FileSystemStorage(location='/path/to/save/file')

    # Save the uploaded file to the drive.
    file_name = fs.save(file.name, file)

```

This will save the uploaded file to the location `/path/to/save/file` with the file name `file_name`.

Which method you use to save the file to the drive without using the database or models depends on your personal preference and the specific needs of your project.

```py
import os

def save_file_to_folder(request, folder_path):
    file = request.FILES['file']

    # Create a new file object.
    with open(os.path.join(folder_path, file.name), 'wb') as new_file:
        # Write the contents of the uploaded file to the new file object.
        for chunk in file.chunks():
            new_file.write(chunk)
```
