# fixtures

Python fixtures are functions that provide data, objects, or resources to test functions.

They are defined in test files and can be shared across test functions.

Fixtures can help simplify test code and make tests more modular and reusable.

The main features of Python fixtures are:

* **Reusable:** Fixtures can be reused across multiple test functions. This can save time and effort, and help to make tests more concise and readable.
* **Modular:** Fixtures can be used to modularize test code, making it easier to maintain and update.
* **Scoped:** Fixtures can be scoped to different levels, such as function, class, module, or session. This allows you to control when fixtures are created and destroyed, and how they are shared between tests.
* **Parametrized:** Fixtures can be parametrized to run with different values. This can be useful for testing different scenarios or configurations.

Here are some examples of how Python fixtures can be used:

* **Provide test data:** Fixtures can be used to provide test data to test functions. This can help to reduce the amount of boilerplate code in tests, and make tests more robust.
* **Create mock objects:** Fixtures can be used to create mock objects for use in tests. This can be useful for testing code that interacts with external systems or resources.
* **Set up test environments:** Fixtures can be used to set up test environments, such as databases or web servers. This can be useful for testing code that interacts with these systems.

Overall, Python fixtures are a powerful tool that can be used to make tests more reusable, modular, and robust.

Here are some additional benefits of using Python fixtures:

* **Tests are more reliable:** Fixtures can help to ensure that tests are more reliable by providing a consistent environment for each test to run in.
* **Tests are easier to maintain:** Fixtures can make tests easier to maintain by encapsulating complex setup and teardown code.
* **Tests are more readable:** Fixtures can make tests more readable by removing boilerplate code from test functions.

If you are writing Python tests, I encourage you to use fixtures to make your tests more reusable, modular, and robust.

## example

Sure, here is an example of a Python fixture that does not use any database:

```python
import pytest

# Define a fixture that provides a list of numbers
@pytest.fixture
def numbers():
    return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Define a test function that uses the numbers fixture
def test_sum_of_numbers(numbers):
    assert sum(numbers) == 15

# Run the test
pytest.main()
```

This fixture simply returns a list of numbers. The test function then uses the list of numbers to calculate the sum and assert that it is equal to 15.

This example shows how fixtures can be used to provide any kind of data to tests, not just database connections. Fixtures can be used to provide test data, mock objects, or any other resources that your tests need.

Here is another example of a fixture that does not use any database:

```python
import pytest

# Define a fixture that provides a mock object for a file system
@pytest.fixture
def mock_file_system():
    class MockFileSystem:
        def __init__(self):
            self.files = {}

        def read_file(self, filename):
            return self.files[filename]

        def write_file(self, filename, content):
            self.files[filename] = content

    return MockFileSystem()

# Define a test function that uses the mock_file_system fixture
def test_write_file(mock_file_system):
    # Write some content to a file
    mock_file_system.write_file("my_file.txt", "Hello, world!")

    # Read the content back from the file
    content = mock_file_system.read_file("my_file.txt")

    # Assert that the content is correct
    assert content == "Hello, world!"

# Run the test
pytest.main()
```

This fixture provides a mock object for a file system. The test function then uses the mock file system to write some content to a file and read it back. Finally, the test function asserts that the content is correct.

This example shows how fixtures can be used to provide mock objects to tests. Mock objects can be useful for testing code that interacts with external systems or resources.

Overall, fixtures are a powerful tool that can be used to provide any kind of data, objects, or resources to tests. This can make tests more reusable, modular, and robust.

## sqlite example

```python
import pytest
import sqlite3

# Define a fixture that provides a database connection
@pytest.fixture
def database_connection():
    conn = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
    yield conn
    conn.close()

# Define a test function that uses the database_connection fixture
def test_create_user(database_connection):
    # Create a new user in the database
    cur = database_connection.cursor()
    cur.execute("CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)")
    cur.execute("INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (?)", ("John Doe",))
    database_connection.commit()

    # Assert that the user was created successfully
    cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
    user = cur.fetchone()
    assert user[1] == "John Doe"

# Run the test
pytest.main()
```

This fixture uses the `sqlite3` library to connect to a database in memory. The test function then uses the connection to create a new user table and insert a new user into the table. Finally, the test function asserts that the user was created successfully.

This example shows how fixtures can be used to provide resources to tests without using any third-party libraries. This can be useful if you want to keep your tests as independent as possible.
